\section{Recap from the previous report}

\subsection{Team Strategy}

Like we stated in the previous report, our team strategy was to ensure that:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The code weâ€™d written followed a consistent coding convention.
    \item Our code individually aligned with the specifications of the design proposed in the previous group meeting.
    \item Our code collectively worked together without any hiccups.
    \item Any pseudo code was converted into code, or discussed at the next group meeting.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structure of the emulator}

\begin{itemize}

    \item The instruction is fetched.
    
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item The instruction is passed to decodeAndExecute which  takes the instruction to find out what type of instruction it is (Branch, Data Processing, etc.)
        \item Depending on the type of instruction, the relevant method is called and the necessary steps, such as updating results, CPSR flags, etc. are taken.
        \item This loops until the halt instruction is fetched.
        \item This loops until the halt instruction is fetched.
    \end{itemize}
  
    \item printState outputs the state of the registers
    \item deallocARMstate frees the memory that was used, ensuring that memory usage isn't bloated

\end{itemize}
